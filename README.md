# Hitori-Solver
Personal project: Creating a script that can solve any Hitori board

Version V1 used for coding competition.

State: Can currently "technically" solve any Hitori board given in any size. However, lack of optimization and inefficencies will lead larger complex boards to require unacceptable runtime to solve. Great for any 5x5 or 6x6 boards, 7x7 ++ will struggle if hard.

Future plans/dreams: Optimize code. Switch search three algoritm from depth-first to A*.
